This Homework-3 was to generate a password dependent on users criteria. 
When you click on generate password button this will begin a function which will prompt/confirm variables and use conditionals to create a password. 
If user doesnt select a password length between 8-128 it will keep prompting user until proper value is selected. 
If user doesnt confirm either special character/upper case/lower case the user will be alerted they must atleast choose one and will be prompted again.
Password will be filled into box on page. 
I was able to fully complete this project but did not attempt bonus copy to clipboard function.
